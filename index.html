        <li><h2>Task/Problem Definition</h2></li>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Introduce your problem.</li></h3>
            <p>Following the pandemic, many institutions plan to maintain a hybrid classroom style, but hybrid learning creates unfair opportunities for in-person and hybrid students because of how it diverts attention away from one group in order to accommodate the other. Part of this is due to the properties of classrooms. For example, classrooms are large and voices are quiet. A large classroom affords fitting more people, but also results in hearing becoming an affordance that is lacking for hybrid users. <br>Other properties are weak microphones and varying camera quality that can only face one direction. Weak microphones deny remote learners the affordance of hearing when the instructor is speaking, and deny students in the classroom the affordance of hearing when remote learners are speaking. Lack of camera quality and direction can result in instructors struggling before class to ensure remote learners have the affordance of seeing the board and instructor, but divert attention away from in-person students and takes up time. <br>Without the affordance of hearing and speaking, remote learners cannot engage with the classroom and those in-person lose the unique perspectives remote students could have brought to discussions.</p>
            <p>Issues demonstrated through the 7 Stages of Action: </p>
            <ol>
                <p><strong>Trigger </strong></p>
                <p>Class is starting and the teacher needs to start a hybrid class session.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
                <p>The teacher wants to connect to their microphone and start talking and teaching to both online and in-person students using Zoom.</p>
                <p><strong>Execution</strong></p>
                <ol><li>Plan: The teacher plans to let the online students into the Zoom, connect their microphone, then start class. They can either use the computer microphone, or connect a wireless microphone to their shirt so they can walk around the room.</li>
                    <li>Specify: The teacher chooses to use the computer microphone because they have had issues with the wireless microphone not connecting in the past.</li>
                    <li>Perform: The teacher enters the classroom, starts the Zoom session, and lets the online students into the session. They unmute their microphone by pressing the unmute button on the Zoom interface and asks if everyone can hear them.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>World</strong></p>
                <p>The online students in the Zoom session express confusion and a few respond that they cannot hear the teacher.</p>
                <p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Perceive: The teacher sees that online students cannot hear them talking. This frustrates them and they start worrying about wasting class time to accommodate online students.</li>
                    <li>Interpret: The teacher interprets the lack of sound as the microphone not being connected because the microphone icon on Zoom is unmuted. There is nothing else on the Zoom interface to either confirm or deny that this is the reason for the teacher being mute. </li>
                    <li>Compare: The teacher compares their situation to when things go smoothly. They realize that when things go smoothly, class starts much sooner and they have more time to cover the material.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <h3><li>Identify your potential users.</li></h3>
            <p>The user population affected by the issues of hybrid learning include teachers and students. For teachers, it affects how effectively they can teach material, and for students, it affects how much attention the teacher can give to either face-to-face students, or online students. A solution to the challenges faced in hybrid learning would make education more accessible by making it possible for a wider range of people to attend classes, and improve the quality of education both face-to-face and online students receive. Online and face-to-face students would also be able to communicate better, resulting in better collaboration, more active learning, and broader perspectives on topics.</p>
        </ol>
        <li><h2>Analysis of Existing Solutions</h2></li>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Describe existing solutions.</li></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zoom</strong></li>
                <p>Zoom is a teleconferencing software that has been adopted for online learning. It is familiar and accessible for most students, and allows meetings with large groups of people. It can also create "breakout" groups so students can discuss in smaller groups. 
                    <br>Unfortunately, Zoom provides limited interaction between face-to-face and online students. Interactions with virtual students can also be hard for other students and the teacher to notice.</p>

                <li><strong>Recorded lectures and shared slides</strong></li>
                <p>Recorded lectures are the easiest way for teachers to ensure face-to-face and online students are getting the same material. The slides can also be studied and reviewed asynchronously by all students. Like Zoom, however, recorded lectures also limit the amount of interaction face-to-face students can have with online students. In most cases, it will entirely separate face-to-face and online students, preventing any interaction.</p>
                <li><strong>Hardware</strong></li>
                <p>There are many companies selling hardware solutions for hybrid learning. Examples of these solutions are wide-angle video cameras, speakerphones, and microphones specifically designed for use by teachers teaching remotely. These solutions are usually compatible with software, such as Zoom, making them attractive to most teachers teaching hybrid classes. These solutions, however, are often expensive and not portable between classrooms.</p>
            </ul>

            <p></p>
            <h3><li>Descibe potential guidelines and solutions.</li></h3>
            <p>Proposed Guidelines: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A hybrid learning solution should enhance the learning of users who choose to attend class online.</li>
                <li>The solution should not negatively impact the learning of face-to-face users.</li>
                <li> The solution should be easy for students and teachers to use, as well as be accessible.</li>
                <li>The solution should promote easy listening and visibility of the material for all users</li>
                <li>The learning experience of the hybrid user should mimic, to some extent, the experience of the in-person user.</li>
            </ul>

        </ol>
        <li><h2>Proposed Solution</h2></li>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Propose a solution.</li></h3>
            <p>The proposed solution has three main components.
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>An interactive note taking platform that allows for collaboration between users.</strong></li>
                    <p>Copies of the lecture slides will be automatically available to all students who are logged into the virtual classroom. Students can then use the notes as a guide while taking notes, and all students will have access to the same information while still actively engaging with the material.</p>
                    <li><strong>Seamless integration with the hardware designed for the platform.</strong></li>
                    <p>Main speakers would be placed throughout the room to allow for easy hearing. Other users can then use their phone or laptop microphones, which are incorporated in the system. When a user speaks into their microphone, the audio will be played through the main speaker system and remote users' speakers. Having a distributed microphone system like this not only helps remote users hear in-person discussion better, but would also help in-person users hear if the user who is speaking has a quiet voice or if located across the room. Remote users would also be able to contribute easier because in-person users would be able to hear them better.</p>
                    <li><strong>A method for creating breakout sections. Users should be able to choose the participants of the groups.</strong></li>
                    <p>Breakout rooms are a great way to encourage discussion and ensure all users are actively participating in discussion. Giving users agency over what groups they are in is also helpful during collaborative work, such as when working on group projects. In breakout groups, the hybrid student's audio and video would only come through on their group members' devices.</p>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h3><li>How will you measure success?</li></h3>
            <p>Success can be measured in multiple ways. One way is surveying teachers and students whether the solution was better or worse than previous solutions. The answers will be subjective, but hearing users' immediate reactions can help gauge general reactions to the solutions.
                <br> A more objective measure would be comparing the students' grades before and after the solution has been implemented for a sufficient amount of time. The course material and teacher would need to remain unchanged between different classes.
                <br> Monitoring the number of students choosing to attend hybrid classes would also measure success by determining how comfortable students are with the solution.
