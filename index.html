            <p>Following the pandemic, many institutions plan to maintain a hybrid classroom style, but hybrid learning creates unfair opportunities for in-person and hybrid students because of how it diverts attention away from one group in order to accommodate the other. Part of this is due to the properties of classrooms. For example, classrooms are large and voices are quiet. A large classroom affords fitting more people, but also results in hearing becoming an affordance that is lacking for hybrid users. Other properties are weak microphones and varying camera quality that can only face one direction. Weak microphones deny remote learners the affordance of hearing when the instructor is speaking, and deny students in the classroom the affordance of hearing when remote learners are speaking. Lack of camera quality and direction can result in instructors struggling before class to ensure remote learners have the affordance of seeing the board and instructor, but divert attention away from in-person students and takes up time. Without the affordance of hearing and speaking, remote learners cannot engage with the classroom and those in-person lose the unique perspectives remote students could have brought to discussions.</p>
