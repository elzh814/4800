        <h3>Update from Milestone 2</h3>
        <p>
            Following Milestone 2 we realized we needed to narrow our scope. Our previous problem was too broad, and did not focus on the “in-person learning” theme as much as we wanted. Our previous problem could be summarized by the line from our previous milestone.
        </p>
        <q>
            Hybrid learning creates unfair opportunities for in-person and hybrid students because of how it diverts attention away from one group in order to accommodate the other.
        </q>
        <p>
            Based on this problem, our solutions ranged from physical hardware, to a redesigned virtual classroom, to multiple changes to the status quo for how this hardware and software would be integrated. It was impossible for our team to give each part of our problem the focus needed to design a solution so we came to the conclusion that we needed to rethink our problem.
            <br>
            We began by identifying the problem associated with hybrid learning and created this list.
            <ol>
                <li>Visibility and audio issues</li>
                <li>Disengagement of virtual students</li>
                <li>Poses difficulties doing group work</li>
            </ol>
            We decided to focus on problem 3, that is, how hybrid learning hinders group work. We choose this problem to focus on because collaboration is a crucial part of classroom learning. Creating and managing efficient breakout rooms was also a part of our original proposed solution so we already understood the problems that arise from collaborative learning in a hybrid setting and are excited to further focus on developing solutions for them.
            <br>
            Now, our problem scope has been successfully narrowed down to:
            <q>
                Hybrid learning creates difficulties for students participating in in-class group work.
            </q>

                <li>"As a student, I want to submit group work so it can be graded."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When we first created our user stories, we were intimidated by the possible scale of the project we were attempting. Despite having a large quantity of user stories, we felt that almost all of them were relevant to our broad problem. Narrowing down our problem scope, however, greatly helped when choosing the most relevant user stories to focus on. <br>
We eliminated the user stories for “watching live lectures” and “giving live lectures” because we felt it was not relevant to our problem scope. Our emphasis had shifted away from ensuring virtual students were getting the same educational experience as face-to-face students, to wanting to give face-to-face students the same benefits that online students had, with a heavy emphasis on improving group collaboration. User stories resulting from wanting to watch or give live lectures were therefore no longer related to this problem. <br>
We primarily choose user stories related to tasks and activities related to group collaboration. This resulted in a majority of our user stories coming from the task categories “taking notes” and “assigning breakout groups” because breakout groups are a . Breakout groups are commonly used for short discussion periods during classrooms, typically lasting a few minutes before the teacher ends them to continue lecturing. We wanted to challenge this status quo and turn breakout rooms into a tool for group collaboration with consistent members. A similar feature was implemented by Zoom in their 5.10.1 version, released March 28, 2022, which allows teachers to manage breakout rooms by reusing the same groups. The implementation of this shows that there is a demand for using breakout groups as a tool for group collaboration so we choose to focus on user stories relevant to this task.<br>
Collaboration, even in breakout groups, is still hindered by the struggle to communicate with peers in a hybrid setting. Because this is a persisting problem, we also choose user stories relevant to how students can communicate non-verbally during a breakout session. Looking at our tasks, the user stories most relevant to the issue of communication are under “Discussion in class”. The majority of these user stories, however, are for users who are attending a live lecture, either in-person or virtually. We applied these user stories to students in a breakout group and found that there was a lot of overlap. Going off of that, we created new user stories to accurately demonstrate how users in a breakout group would want to communicate with their teammates and included those in our chosen relevant user stories. <br>
