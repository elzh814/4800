                    Does our software increase the learning and satisfaction of hybrid learning groups above the most
                    commonly used software? Do hybrid students using our software receive the same level of education as
                    in- person learning groups?

                        2 individuals in hybrid groups are assigned as online students, and 2 are assigned as in-person

        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Results come in the form of grades on group assignments and individual exam, as well as satisfaction
                rating from questionnaire
            </li>
            <li>
                Comparing results between groups
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Compare mean of project scores from experimental group to means of the control groups
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compare mean exam score of experimental group to mean exam scores from controls
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Comparing mean satisfaction scores of experimental group against controls
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Comparing results across groups
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Exam scores from In person students vs online students in hybrid groups (answers the question:
                        do the scores from in-person students skew the group data?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Satisfaction ratings from in-person vs online students (does the software benefit both parties?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scores and satisfaction ratings: Virtual students (experimental group) vs virtual students
                        (control) (how does our software compare to the alternatives?)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Possible Results</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If scores are high in between group analysis, we can conclude that our software improved the learning of
                groups over the alternative softwares
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Results close to the baseline control (in-person groups condition) we can conclude that our
                        software is as effective as in-person groups
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Across Groups
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If scores between in-person and hybrid students are similar, we can rule out the in-person
                        scores as confounds that pull the hybrid groups up
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the satisfaction rating are high in both in-person and virtual students from experimental
                        group, we can say the software benefits both parties
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If scores and satisfaction ratings from the experimental virtual students are better than
                        controls, we can be confident saying our software works better than the alternatives
                    </li>
